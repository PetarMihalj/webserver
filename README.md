# A Python Webserver

A mini-project which demonstrates the use of decorators in modern web frameworks.
Both Django and Spring frameworks use similar techniques to allow for rapid prototyping and clean design.

### Prerequisites

The only required software is **Python3**.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Run main.py with the following syntax "python main.py get_methods"
3. Your local hosted website should now be available at localhost:8080

## Decorators

I strongly suggest reading Luciano RamalhoË™s "Fluent Python" chapter on "Function Decorators and Closures".
After you get the basic idea, you can inspect my code to learn about it in practice.
